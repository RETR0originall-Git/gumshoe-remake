# Gumshoe Remake
Recreated Gumshoe extension that works! Original repo: [click for more informations](https://github.com/ajar/gumshoe)
Gumshoe is a Chrome extension for discreet password logging. It monitors the submission of all forms with a password field and stores any unique login details in a local database.

2. Extract it to any location on your computer. (Extract to folder **'src'**)

# Is it safe?
Yep. But in your case it depends, the extension is open-source so you always free to see code.
The remake doesn't change any other things, your password, emails are still save in local Data Base, you don't have to panic.
Everything locally, in other ways: I can't steal your data.
