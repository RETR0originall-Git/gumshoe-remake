Recreated Gumshoe extension that works! Original rep: [click for more informations](https://github.com/ajar/gumshoe)
Gumshoe is a Chrome extension for discreet password logging. It monitors the submission of all forms with a password field and stores any unique login details in a local database.

I am not the original author or creator of the extension â€“ I only updated it. Have fun!
