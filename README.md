# Gumshoe Remake
Recreated Gumshoe extension that works! Original rep: [click for more informations](https://github.com/ajar/gumshoe)
Gumshoe is a Chrome extension for discreet password logging. It monitors the submission of all forms with a password field and stores any unique login details in a local database.

I am not the original author or creator of the extension – I only updated it. Have fun!

2. Extract it to any location on your computer.
3. Go to your browser’s extension settings, enable Developer Mode, then click 'Import unpacked' and select the extracted folder from the package.
