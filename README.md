# Gumshoe Remake
Recreated Gumshoe extension that works! Original rep: [click for more informations](https://github.com/ajar/gumshoe)
Gumshoe is a Chrome extension for discreet password logging. It monitors the submission of all forms with a password field and stores any unique login details in a local database.

I am not the original author or creator of the extension – I only updated it. Have fun!

# How to import extension into browser? 
1. Download the package from the [release](https://github.com/RETR0originall-Git/gumshoe-remake/releases/tag/JavaScript), **and make sure to get the latest version!**
2. Extract it to any location on your computer.
3. Go to your browser’s extension settings, enable Developer Mode, then click 'Import unpacked' and select the extracted folder from the package.
4. If you find some problems or bugs, you can try contant with me.

# Is it safe?
Yep. But in your case it depends, the extension is open-source so you always free to see code.
The remake doesn't change any other things, your password, emails are still save in local Data Base, you don't have to panic.
Everything locally, other ways: I can't steal your data.
